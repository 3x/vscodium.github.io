<h2><a id="why"></a>Why Does This Exist</h2>
<p>VSCode is a powerful advanced text editor developed by Microsoft using the Electronjs framework.</p>

<p>VSCode is a <strong>Free and Open Source software</strong> released under the MIT license, but it is only available as source code
from its <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode" target="_blank">official Github repository</a></p>

<p>Microsoft then distributes its own ready to use binaries called Visual Studio Code on the official project website.</p>

<p>Even if the source code of VSCode is released under a Free and Open Source license,
Microsoft’s downloads of Visual Studio Code are licensed under <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/license">this not-FLOSS license</a> and contain telemetry/tracking. According to <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60#issuecomment-161792005">this comment</a> from a Visual Studio Code maintainer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we [Microsoft] build Visual Studio Code, we do exactly this. We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license.</p>

  <p>When you clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a “clean” build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The VSCodium project exists so that you don’t have to download+build from source. This project includes special build scripts that clone Microsoft’s vscode repo, run the build commands, and upload the resulting binaries for you to <a href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases">GitHub releases</a>. <strong>These binaries are licensed under the MIT license. Telemetry is enabled by a build flag which we do not pass.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to build from source yourself, head over to <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode">Microsoft’s vscode repo</a> and follow their <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#build-and-run">instructions</a>. This repo exists to make it easier to get the latest version of MIT-licensed VSCode.</p>
