# Migrate from Visual Studio Code


VSCodium (and a freshly cloned copy of vscode built from source) stores its extension files in `~/.vscode-oss`. So if you currently have Visual Studio Code installed, your extensions won't automatically populate. You can reinstall your extensions from the Marketplace in VSCodium, or copy the `extensions` from `~/.vscode/extensions` to `~/.vscode-oss/extensions`.

Visual Studio Code stores its `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` file in the these locations:
- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\Code\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/Code/User`

You can copy these files to the VSCodium user settings folder:
- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\VSCodium\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/VSCodium/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/VSCodium/User`

To copy your settings manually:
- In Visual Studio Code, go to Settings (Command+, if on a Mac)
- Click the three dots `...` and choose 'Open settings.json'
- Copy the contents of settings.json into the same place in VSCodium

## <a id="press-and-hold"></a>How do I press and hold a key and have it repeat in VSCodium (Mac)?
This is a common question for Visual Studio Code and the procedure is slightly different in VSCodium because the `defaults` path is different.

```bash
$ defaults write com.visualstudio.code.oss ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

## <a id="terminal-support"></a>How do I open VSCodium from the terminal?
- Go to the command palette (View | Command Palette...)
- Choose `Shell command: Install 'vscodium' command in PATH`.

This allows you to open files or directories in VSCodium directly from your terminal:

```bash
~/in-my-project $ vscodium . # open this directory
~/in-my-project $ vscodium file.txt # open this file
```

Feel free to alias this command to something easier to type in your shell profile (e.g. `alias code=vscodium`).
